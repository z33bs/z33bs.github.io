# My personal site

Uses Jekyl with the following features:

* Icons from fontawesome v3.2
* profile and fav-icon use gravatar profile
* analytics uses: gauge.es and google
* gridism - A simple responsive CSS grid. [View the demo â†’](http://cobyism.com/gridism/)
* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

## Todo

* change default template to use markdown for all pages
  * Note difference between 2 test pages
    * /investor/ 
      * uses folder to determine permalink
      * doesn't use the markdown layout
    * /about/
      * uses permalink to make path
      * Uses the markdown layout
* explicitly set style for large font on landing page
* update dependencies
